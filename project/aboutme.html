    <p>
        As a third-year student majoring in Network Technology at Carleton University, I'm eager to transition into web development, leveraging my strong foundation in computer science and networking principles. Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I've cultivated a passion for crafting intuitive user experiences and building dynamic web applications. Through self-directed learning and hands-on projects, I've honed my skills and developed a keen eye for detail. With a commitment to continuous growth and a collaborative mindset, I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my technical expertise and creativity to innovative web development projects.
